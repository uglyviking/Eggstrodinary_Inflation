## Results of the Shapiro-Wilk normality tests

### First option with unaltered data set


```data:  inflation_long$Overall_Inflation```

```W = 0.96145, p-value = 6.232e-07```

### Second option with outliers removed

```data:  inflation_long_no_outliers$Overall_Inflation_no_outliers```

```W = 0.98683, p-value = 0.01393```

With both p-values below 0.05 it seems the data isn't necessarily normal but please take a look at the histograms and qq-plots.
